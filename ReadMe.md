# World Travel Itinerary

This project includes a database compiled from OpenWeather, including weather conditions in a randomly generated collection of cities around the world. 

From these, a subset of cities was chosen, with appealing weather for vacation travel. In this case, max temperature of 70-80Â°F.

Google Maps Places API was used to identify a hotel near the coordinates for the city. 

A heatmap is included with markers for the cities included. The map includes info boxes which identify the hotel for that city, and the current weather conditions (as of 10/16/21).

From the map, I chose four cities within driving distance to generate an itinerary to visit all of them. These cities are located in the Pacific Northwest of the US. I chose to begin the trip in Montana. 
There are few roads leading in and out of Montana, and as it happens, the best route back to Montana from our third stop, was to go back through the previous.

A heatmap is included which identifies the four cities, the hotels chosen, and weather conditions on 10/16/21.
